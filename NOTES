Step 2: Create and edit first basic react project
------
start with 
>>npm install
>>npm create_react_app my_app
>>npm start 

This will start up a browser http://localhost:3000 with teh first and basi react page

To get started, edit src/App.js and save to reload.

Without having to restart, you wil instantly see the updates on the browser(http://localhost:3000)

you should see an empty tic-tac-toe field.

However, if teh page is already up and running, then you will see teh update dynamically. :)
